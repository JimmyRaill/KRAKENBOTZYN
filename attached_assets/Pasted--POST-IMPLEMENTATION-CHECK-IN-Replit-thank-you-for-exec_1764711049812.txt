## ✅ POST-IMPLEMENTATION CHECK-IN

Replit, thank you for executing the strategy overhaul. Please confirm and summarize the following so we can ensure everything was implemented exactly as intended:

---

### 🔁 1. FILTER ADJUSTMENTS

- ✅ Did you **reduce the ATR threshold** from 0.3% to 0.2%?  
  - If so, where is this defined (config, constant, inline)?
  - Does it now *warn but allow* trades between 0.2%–0.3%?

- ✅ Did you **expand the symbol whitelist** to include:
  `['BTC', 'ETH', 'SOL', 'UNI', 'ATOM', 'LTC', 'ARB', 'OP', 'AAVE']`?
  - Where is this list defined?
  - Is it **configurable externally** (e.g., via config or env var)?
  - Does logging now indicate when a symbol is rejected and why?

- ✅ Did you adjust the **regime/HTF filter** to be a soft filter now?
  - Confirm that trades can pass with UNKNOWN regime if signal confidence ≥ 0.65.
  - Is the override logic functioning at ≥ 0.75 confidence?

### ⚙️ 2. SIGNAL DECISION + CONFIDENCE

- ✅ Have you implemented signal confidence thresholds for trade approval?
  - What is the actual cutoff value?
  - What happens if confidence is borderline?

- ✅ Did you add any logic to boost confidence for breakouts (e.g., RSI > 70, ADX > 25, price > SMA20)?

---

### 🛒 3. ORDER EXECUTION STRATEGY

- ✅ Did you replace **all Kraken orders** with `market` orders only?
  - No stop-loss orders?
  - No take-profit orders?
  - Where is this implemented in code?
  - Can you show a sample buy and sell function?

- ✅ Are mental stop-loss / take-profit levels still calculated and **trigger a market sell**?
  - Where is this logic defined?

---

### 🔒 4. SPOT-ONLY ENFORCEMENT

- ✅ Can you confirm all trading is restricted to **spot** only?
  - No margin, no futures, no shorting?
  - Was any logic removed or disabled?
  - Is there a check/warning in case a restricted action is attempted?

---

### 🧪 5. TESTING + VERIFICATION

- ✅ Did you re-run `test_data_logger.py` or any tests to confirm nothing broke?
- ✅ Have you backtested this version to verify trades are flowing correctly now?

Please reply with a summary of:
- What you implemented
- Where key changes live in the codebase
- Any files/functions you created or refactored
- Anything that gave you trouble or remains unfinished

Thanks! Looking forward to confirming it's airtight.
