You are working on the existing KrakenTradingBot (Zyn) project in Replit.

GOAL: PHASE 4A — HOUSEKEEPING ONLY (NO STRATEGY/RISK/LOGIC CHANGES)

We have just completed a full health audit of Zyn. The architecture and logic are solid and safe. Now we want you to perform **only the small housekeeping tasks** that clean up noise without changing Zyn’s trading behavior.

This is a **TARGETED MAINTENANCE PHASE**, NOT a feature or strategy change.

You MAY:
- Run SQL against the existing SQLite DB.
- Restart workflows (autopilot, chat) if needed.
- Make tiny, surgical code edits ONLY where explicitly specified below.

You MUST NOT:
- Change any risk parameters.
- Change any filters or gates (regime, fee, symbol).
- Change any strategy logic.
- Change execution mode (must remain LIMIT_BRACKET).
- Change any SL/TP/bracket logic.

==================================================
TASK 1 — CLEAN STALE PAPER-MODE DB ENTRIES
==================================================

From the audit, we know there are ~4 stale entries from older paper-mode tests in the `pending_child_orders` table — symbols ARKM/USD, AAVE/USD, ALGO/USD — causing repeated OCO/SL-enrichment warnings.

1. Open and inspect the SQLite database used by `evaluation_log.py`.
   - Confirm the structure and locate the `pending_child_orders` table.

2. Run a SELECT query to see the exact stale rows:
   - Something like:
     - SELECT * FROM pending_child_orders WHERE symbol IN ('ARKM/USD','AAVE/USD','ALGO/USD');

3. If these entries:
   - Have no meaningful link to current live trading (they should be from old paper mode / test runs),
   - Are not active live brackets,

   THEN delete them with a targeted DELETE, e.g.:
   - DELETE FROM pending_child_orders WHERE symbol IN ('ARKM/USD','AAVE/USD','ALGO/USD');

4. Re-run a SELECT to confirm the rows are gone.

5. Do NOT delete any other rows unless they are clearly the same paper-mode junk. This is a surgical cleanup.

You MUST report back:
- How many rows you found per symbol.
- How many rows were deleted.
- The exact SQL you ended up using.

==================================================
TASK 2 — FIX CHAT WORKFLOW PORT CONFLICT
==================================================

The audit showed:
- Chat interface error: `[Errno 98] address already in use` on port 5000,
- Meaning an old process is still holding the port.

Your job:

1. Identify the chat workflow / process in this Replit project that listens on the port (likely 5000 or whatever is configured).
2. Cleanly restart that workflow:
   - Stop any existing instance that’s bound to the port.
   - Restart the chat workflow / process.
3. Verify:
   - The process starts without `[Errno 98] address already in use`.
   - It binds successfully to the intended port.
   - There are no new runtime errors.

You MUST NOT:
- Change the port number.
- Change any core chat logic or endpoints.

You MUST report back:
- What you restarted.
- How you confirmed the port conflict is gone.

==================================================
TASK 3 — UPDATE ASSET SCANNER FOR MATIC → POL
==================================================

The audit logs showed:
- OHLC fetch error: `MATIC/USD` is not a valid Kraken symbol anymore (renamed to `POL/USD`).

We want the asset scanner to stop trying to trade/fetch MATIC/USD and use the correct symbol, but **without expanding the trading universe beyond what we already use**.

Your job:

1. Find where the universe of symbols is defined or iterated:
   - It may be in a config file, symbol list module, or asset scanner code.
   - Search for "MATIC" and "MATIC/USD".

2. Confirm:
   - How that symbol is being used (scanning only vs eligible for trading).
   - That this change will NOT accidentally add a new symbol to the whitelist or trading universe beyond what we are already using.

3. Update the symbol(s) as needed so that:
   - Any place trying to fetch or scan `MATIC/USD` is changed to the correct Kraken symbol (`POL/USD` or the current equivalent according to the Kraken API used in this project).
   - Keep the behavior consistent with current design (if it was “just scan, not trade”, keep it that way).

4. After update:
   - Restart the autopilot workflow if necessary.
   - Confirm in the logs that:
     - The MATIC/USD OHLC error no longer appears.
     - No new OHLC errors appear for POL/USD or any other symbol.

You MUST report back:
- Which file(s) you modified.
- The before/after of the symbol definition or usage.
- Confirmation that MATIC-related errors are gone.

==================================================
TASK 4 — VERIFY NO NEW WARNINGS AND OVERALL HEALTH
==================================================

After completing Tasks 1–3:

1. Restart any workflows you touched (autopilot, chat, reconciliation, etc.) to ensure they’re running with a clean state.

2. Let the system run long enough to:
   - Do at least one full evaluation cycle over the symbol universe.
   - Do at least one reconciliation/OCO cycle.

3. Check logs for:

   - That the previous noisy patterns are resolved:
     - No more OCO/SL-enrichment warnings tied to ARKM/AAVE/ALGO paper-mode entries.
     - No more MATIC/USD OHLC errors.
     - No more port 5000 `[Errno 98]` on chat startup.

   - That normal behavior remains intact:
     - Symbol whitelist blocks non-BTC/ETH/SOL symbols.
     - Regime filter still blocks low-ATR or low-trend markets as before.
     - Fee gate and risk limits behave unchanged.
     - No crashes, no new tracebacks.

4. DO NOT adjust thresholds, configs, or strategies even if you think they’re “too strict”. This phase is about cleaning noise, not changing behavior.

==================================================
TASK 5 — FINAL SUMMARY BACK TO JIMMY
==================================================

At the end, provide a clear summary Jimmy can copy/paste elsewhere, with this structure:

1. **DB Cleanup Results**
   - How many rows were removed from pending_child_orders and for which symbols.
   - Confirmation that no active/live entries were touched.

2. **Chat Workflow Status**
   - What was restarted.
   - Whether the port conflict is fully resolved.

3. **Asset Scanner Update**
   - Which file(s) were changed.
   - Exactly how MATIC → POL (or equivalent) was updated.
   - Confirmation that the MATIC/USD OHLC error no longer appears.

4. **Post-Cleanup Health Check**
   - Whether any of the previous warnings are still present.
   - Whether any new warnings/errors appeared.
   - Confirmation that execution mode, risk settings, filters, and gates are unchanged and still working as before.

Remember:
- This is **Phase 4A maintenance**, not a refactor or feature phase.
- The priority is to remove noise and keep Zyn’s behavior identical, just cleaner.

End of Phase 4A request.
