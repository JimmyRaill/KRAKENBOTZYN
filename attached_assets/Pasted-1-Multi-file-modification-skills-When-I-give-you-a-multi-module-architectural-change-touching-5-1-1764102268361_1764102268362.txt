1. Multi-file modification skills

When I give you a multi-module architectural change (touching 5–10 files), do you:

Modify all needed files in a single response?

Or do you require smaller, isolated prompts per file?
Explain your preferred workflow.

2. Architecture comprehension

Given a large repo with interconnected modules, are you able to:

Understand cross-file relationships (e.g., execution_manager ↔ autopilot ↔ risk_manager)?

Make edits that respect those boundaries such as not breaking API contracts between modules?
Explain what level of architectural context you maintain during edits.

3. Safety and non-destructive editing

If asked to change functionality, will you:

Modify only targeted sections?

Avoid rewriting entire files unless explicitly instructed?

Preserve existing code structure unless change is necessary?
Explain your approach.

4. Kraken API understanding

How confident are you with:

Kraken Spot REST API

Limit orders

Stop-loss orders

Take-profit limit orders

Understanding Kraken’s restriction that TP + SL cannot be combined in a single OCO?
Tell me what you already know and what assumptions you typically make.

5. Handling state machines and bracket logic

If I instruct you to design or modify a state machine like:
FLAT → ENTRY_PLACED → ENTRY_FILLED → BRACKET_ACTIVE → EXIT
can you:

Keep logic consistent across multiple modules?

Avoid race-condition-prone edits?

Respect existing locking files or state files?
Explain your comfort level.

6. Respecting existing configuration flags

If I instruct you to add new config flags or env vars (e.g., EXECUTION_MODE), are you able to:

Integrate them across modules

Ensure they toggle behavior safely

Ensure backward compatibility
Explain how you handle config-driven behavior.

7. Safeguards against hallucination

Do you sometimes:

Invent functions that do not exist?

Assume Kraken supports features it does not?

Alter API calls incorrectly?
If so, how can I prompt you clearly so that you remain grounded in the actual codebase?

8. Incremental build workflow

If I say:
“PLAN only — do not write code yet”
or
“BUILD this exact part only — nothing else”
will you reliably follow that?
Explain how I can structure prompts to make sure you don’t take unwanted actions.

9. Understanding trading logic & strategy

Are you able to reason about:

Strategy logic

Risk management

Position sizing

Fees

Execution behaviors
without rewriting large parts of the code?
Give your honest limits.

10. Your best-working prompt style

What style of prompts do you respond best to?

Long-form, detailed instructions?

Structured bullet points?

Short incremental steps?

One-file-at-a-time?

High-level architecture plans?
Tell me which format leads to the safest and most accurate work from you.

11. Testing & verification

After making changes, can you:

Validate that imports still work?

Verify that adjacent modules still match expected function signatures?

Perform internal logic consistency checks?
Explain your validation approach.

12. Limitations

Finally — tell me all of your limitations when working on a project like this.
I need to know exactly what you struggle with so that I (and ChatGPT/GPT-5.1) can compensate for it.

Please answer each question clearly and in detail. This will let us tailor all future prompts so we work together effectively.
