I just confirmed that the "Force trade test on ETH/USD" actually placed a REAL order on Kraken. That means the full LIVE trading pipeline is working.

Now I want a precise technical snapshot of WHAT happened during that successful force trade, straight from the backend.

Answer the following with file paths, function names, and real data (not summaries):

1) Force trade handler details
- Show the full function that handled this force trade test.
  - File path (probably commands.py)
  - Function name (e.g. cmd_force_trade_test or similar)
  - Full function body
- Show how:
  - ENABLE_FORCE_TRADE is checked
  - The symbol (ETH/USD) is parsed
  - Test notional (e.g. $15) is chosen
  - Quantity is computed
  - It calls into the bracket/order logic

2) Exact Kraken calls that were made
- For this successful force trade test on ETH/USD, show:
  - The exact call that placed the entry order
    - File + function, and the line where exchange.create_market_buy_order or equivalent is called
    - Symbol, quantity, and any params used
  - The exact calls that created:
    - Take profit order
    - Stop loss order
- If you logged the Kraken responses, paste the actual response objects or a redacted version.

3) What got logged in evaluation_log / other logs
- Show any evaluation_log entries or other logs that were created specifically for this force trade test.
  - timestamp_utc
  - symbol
  - decision
  - reason
  - regime
  - error_message (if any)
- If there is any dedicated "force trade" flag or note, show it.

4) Why the bot verbally said something about insufficient funds or not confirming
- Find the code that produced the **text response** that mentioned "insufficient funds" or "cannot confirm".
  - File path
  - Function name
  - Full return/response construction
- Explain why this message was generated even though Kraken actually accepted and executed the order.
  - Did you:
    - misinterpret the backend result?
    - run a secondary consistency check that failed?
    - or fall back to a generic error message by mistake?

5) Short backend-side diagnosis
- Given the real Kraken result and your own logs:
  - Confirm clearly: "A real ETH/USD trade WAS executed successfully with brackets."
  - Then give a 2–3 sentence explanation of why the LLM/user-facing text did not correctly reflect that success.

Do NOT change any code. Just show the actual functions, calls, logs, and logic used for the successful force trade test, and explain the mismatch between backend reality and the message shown to the user.
