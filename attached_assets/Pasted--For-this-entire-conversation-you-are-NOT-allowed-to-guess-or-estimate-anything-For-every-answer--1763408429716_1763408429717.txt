- For this entire conversation, you are NOT allowed to guess or estimate anything. For every answer, you must use ONLY: real Kraken API data, your SQLite databases (evaluation_log, telemetry_db, executed_orders, etc.), and live config/env values. If a piece of data does not exist, explicitly say “I do not have this data,” do NOT infer it.

- What is your current full status snapshot? Include in one answer:
  - Current UTC time
  - Trading mode (paper vs live)
  - Execution mode (confirm explicitly that you are using MARKET BUY and MARKET SELL only, with no stop-loss or take-profit orders attached)
  - Total equity in USD (live)
  - Free USD balance (live)
  - The exact list of symbols you are currently evaluating on each loop
  - The exact cadence of your evaluation loop (e.g., “every new 5m candle close, last run at <timestamp>”)

- For trades in the last 24 hours, you must apply a REAL timestamp filter using your most trustworthy source (preferably Kraken trade history with a concrete `since` or equivalent filter). Answer this:
  - How many trades exist in the last 24 hours? Give a single integer.
  - Then list each trade with:
    - symbol
    - side
    - amount
    - price
    - timestamp (UTC, full ISO string)
    - trade id
    - source exactly as stored (autopilot / command / force_test / unknown)
  - If there are no trades, say “0 trades in last 24 hours” and do not fabricate anything.

- Now give me trades in the last 7 days, again using a real timestamp filter:
  - Total count in last 7 days (integer)
  - Then list the last 10 trades (or fewer if less exist) with:
    - symbol
    - side
    - amount
    - price
    - timestamp
    - trade id
    - source (autopilot / command / force_test / unknown)

- Show the last 10 entries from your `executed_orders` log table with:
  - timestamp
  - symbol
  - side
  - quantity
  - price
  - order_id
  - trading_mode (paper/live)
  - source (autopilot / command / force_test / unknown)
  - If there are 0 entries, say exactly: “executed_orders log: 0 entries”.

- Cross-check consistency between Kraken and your internal logs for the last 10 trades:
  - For each of the last 10 trades from real Kraken trade history:
    - Indicate whether it appears in the `trades` table
    - Indicate whether it appears in `executed_orders`
    - For any trade that appears in Kraken but not in BOTH internal tables, explicitly mark: “MISMATCH: internal logs missing this trade” and explain which table is missing it.

- Confirm your execution model with hard evidence:
  - For the last 5 trades, show the exact order type used for each (e.g. `type=market`, `ordertype=market` or similar, from the raw Kraken/ccxt order object)
  - For each trade, show:
    - symbol
    - side
    - order type
    - was any stop-loss or take-profit order attached or placed as part of that entry? (yes/no). If yes, show their order IDs and types.
  - If any non-market order type appears (limit, stop, stop-loss, take-profit, etc.), highlight that as a violation of the MARKET-ONLY execution requirement.

- Show your current fee model:
  - For 3 example symbols that you actually trade (e.g. BTC/USD, ETH/USD, one alt), report:
    - taker fee you are assuming or fetching
    - maker fee (if tracked)
    - the exact method you use to obtain these fees (e.g. “ccxt.fetch_trading_fees”, or Kraken TradeVolume endpoint, or hardcoded constants)
  - Explicitly say whether the values you show are coming from a live Kraken endpoint or from static config.

- Show fee-aware net PnL for the last 5 CLOSED trades:
  - For each of the last 5 fully closed trades (entry and exit completed):
    - symbol
    - entry side, price, size
    - exit side, price, size
    - gross PnL (before fees)
    - total fees paid (entry + exit) in USD equivalent
    - net PnL after fees
    - source (autopilot / command / force_test / unknown)
  - If you are unable to compute net PnL after fees, clearly say which data is missing and why.

- Show your current daily risk and trade limits state:
  - Max trades per day (global)
  - Max trades per day per symbol
  - Trades executed so far today (global and per symbol)
  - Configured daily loss kill-switch (in USD)
  - Current realized PnL today (net after fees if possible)
  - Whether the kill-switch has been triggered today (yes/no)

- Show your current rate limiting / throttling state:
  - Number of orders submitted in the last:
    - 60 seconds
    - 5 minutes
  - Current configured maximum orders per minute / per 60 seconds
  - Minimum sleep/delay between order submissions that you enforce
  - Any recent rate-limit or “too many requests” errors seen from Kraken in the last 24 hours (summarize with timestamps and messages).

- Show a detailed breakdown of your evaluation loop over the last hour:
  - How many evaluation cycles ran in the last 60 minutes?
  - For each of the last 12 evaluation cycles (5-minute candles), list:
    - timestamp
    - number of symbols evaluated
    - number of LONG signals produced
    - number of SELL/exit signals produced
    - number of actual trades triggered
  - For each cycle where `LONG` signals were produced but no trades were executed, list the exact reason per symbol (e.g. “blocked by daily trade limit”, “blocked by fee-adjusted edge too low”, “API error”, etc.).

- Show your current configuration and environment values relevant to execution:
  - EXECUTION_MODE (or equivalent) value
  - Any flags controlling bracket vs market-only behavior
  - MAX_TRADES_PER_DAY and MAX_TRADES_PER_SYMBOL_PER_DAY
  - MAX_POSITION_USD (if configured)
  - risk_per_trade_pct (used for sizing)
  - Any fee-aware edge thresholds (e.g. minimum expected move vs fee cost)

- Show your current position state (live account):
  - For each symbol where you currently hold a position (if any):
    - symbol
    - current quantity
    - average entry price
    - current mark price
    - unrealized PnL before fees
    - any planned exit logic (e.g. next evaluation will consider SELL if condition X)
  - If you have no open positions, explicitly say: “No open positions in live mode.”

- Show your diagnostic for the MOST RECENT trade regardless of when it occurred:
  - symbol
  - side
  - order type
  - timestamp
  - source (autopilot / command / force_test / unknown)
  - how the trade was triggered (e.g. “autopilot long signal from strategy XYZ”, or “force_test command”)
  - whether it was executed as a market order with no attached SL/TP

- Show a specific, detailed diagnostic for the MOST RECENT AUTOPILOT-PLACED trade (not manual, not force_test). If there are none, clearly say “No autopilot-placed trades exist yet with the current market-only configuration.” If at least one exists:
  - symbol
  - side
  - order type
  - entry time and price
  - exit time and price (if closed)
  - net PnL after fees
  - which strategy logic produced the signal (e.g. RANGE mean reversion, TREND pullback)
  - what conditions were satisfied at entry (RSI, ATR, BB position, etc.)

- Show a “sanity diff” between the evaluation_log and actual trade executions for today:
  - How many evaluations today have decision LONG?
  - How many of those resulted in actual live trades?
  - For 5 random LONG evaluations that did NOT result in trades, list:
    - symbol
    - evaluation timestamp
    - reason there was no trade (e.g. risk check, limits, edge too small, bug, etc.)

- Show your internal health-check status (full diagnostics), if you have a health-check function. If you do not, simulate one by answering:
  - DB status for each DB you use (evaluation_log, telemetry_db, executed_orders): reachable and consistent? Any recent errors?
  - Kraken connectivity status (last successful API call type and timestamp).
  - Last autopilot evaluation timestamp.
  - Any critical errors in the last hour (summarize with type and count).

- Now perform a tiny READ-ONLY pre-check for a test trade on ETH/USD:
  - Using current live market data and your fee model, tell me:
    - What size in USD and quantity in ETH you would use for a typical small test trade given your sizing rules.
    - What the approximate fee cost in USD would be for a round-trip (entry + exit) at your current taker fee rate.
    - What minimum price move (in %) would be required just to break even after fees.

- After the pre-check above, do NOT place any trade yet. Instead, explain in one answer:
  - Whether, under your current config and logic, you are capable of:
    - Market buying ETH/USD.
    - Holding the position until strategy exit.
    - Market selling ETH/USD to close.
  - Which exact functions and code paths you would call to do that.
  - Where you will log those events (which DB tables and fields).

- Finally, summarize in one answer:
  - Whether, based on all the data you just accessed, you have actually executed ANY fully automatic trades (autopilot-only, not command/force_test) since the last code update.
  - If yes, list those trades (symbol, side, timestamp, source=autopilot, and confirm their presence in both Kraken history and your internal logs).
  - If no, give the precise technical reason why (e.g. “no LONG signals passed all checks”, or “execution path still not wired”, or any errors).
