- You are not allowed to guess in any way. You must use ONLY:
  - Live Kraken API data for my account
  - Your SQLite databases (evaluation_log.db, trading_memory.db, etc.)
  - Your executed_orders table/log
  - Your current .env/config values
  Do not infer, assume, or “probably” anything. If some data is unavailable, say exactly what’s missing and why.

- What is the current UTC time right now, according to your system?

- What is your current trading mode and config?
  - trading_mode (live or paper)
  - USE_BRACKETS (True / False)
  - order style currently used by AUTOPILOT (market only, limit only, or mix – based on actual config, not marketing text)
  - AUTONOMOUS flag (0/1)

- What symbol universe are you actually evaluating right now?
  - Are you using the dynamic universe scanner or static SYMBOLS?
  - List every symbol you evaluated in the LAST FULL AUTOPILOT LOOP (not “in general”, but from the most recent loop).

- Trades in the LAST 24 HOURS (REAL, timestamp-filtered):
  - Apply a hard cutoff: now_utc - 24 hours.
  - How many trades exist in that window from the REAL Kraken API for my account? Give a single integer.
  - Then list each of those trades with:
    - symbol
    - side
    - amount
    - price
    - timestamp
    - trade id
  - For each of those same trades, if you have a matching record in ANY internal DB (trades table / executed_orders), show:
    - which table it appears in
    - source field exactly as stored (autopilot / command / force_test / unknown)
  - For any Kraken trade in that window that does NOT appear in your internal DBs, explicitly say: “Missing from internal logs: [trade id]”.

- Trades in the LAST 7 DAYS:
  - Apply a real 7-day cutoff: now_utc - 7 days.
  - How many total trades in that 7-day window from Kraken? (single integer)
  - How many of those 7-day trades are labeled in your DBs as:
    - source = autopilot
    - source = command
    - source = force_test
    - source = unknown

- Internal executed_orders log:
  - Show the LAST 10 entries from executed_orders with:
    - timestamp
    - symbol
    - side
    - quantity
    - price
    - order_id
    - trading_mode
    - source
  - If there are fewer than 10, show all.
  - If there are 0 entries, say exactly: “executed_orders log: 0 entries”.

- Autopilot vs manual/force in the LAST 24 HOURS:
  - Based ONLY on your internal logs:
    - How many trades were placed with source="autopilot" in the last 24 hours?
    - How many with source="command"?
    - How many with source="force_test"?
  - Cross-check that the sum of those equals the count of trades you see in your DBs for that same 24-hour window. If they don’t match, say: “Mismatch between source breakdown and DB trade count.”

- Most recent AUTOPILOT trade (not command, not force_test):
  - Does any trade in your internal logs have source="autopilot"?
  - If yes:
    - Give symbol, side, size, price, timestamp, trade id, and order id.
    - Confirm with Kraken API that this trade actually exists on Kraken (same trade id and timestamp).
    - If it does NOT exist on Kraken, say: “Internal log shows autopilot trade that does NOT exist on Kraken: [trade id].”
  - If no autopilot trades exist in your logs, say exactly: “No confirmed autopilot trades exist in my internal logs.”

- Last force trade test status:
  - Look at your MOST RECENT trade with source="force_test" or “force_trade_test” (from your internal logs).
  - For that trade only, answer:
    - Did Kraken confirm the entry order? (yes/no – using Kraken data)
    - symbol, side, size, price
    - trade id and order id
    - Did you place any exit order related to that entry (sell, close, etc.)?
    - Did you log that exit anywhere in your internal DBs? If yes, where? If not, say it clearly.

- Execution bug check:
  - During the LAST 10 AUTOPILOT LOOPS:
    - How many times did you generate a non-HOLD decision (e.g., LONG / SHORT / SELL / EXIT)?
    - For each such decision, did you:
      - reach the actual order placement function?
      - hit any exceptions or errors?
    - If ANY exception or error happened between signal and order placement, show:
      - the exact error message
      - the file and line (if available)
      - which symbol it affected.

- Strategy evaluation vs actual trades TODAY (UTC day):
  - How many evaluations have you logged today (count of rows in evaluations for today’s date)?
  - How many of those evaluations had decision in ('LONG', 'SHORT', 'SELL', 'EXIT')?
  - How many actual trades (from Kraken) happened today?
  - If the number of non-HOLD decisions > 0 and the number of trades from Kraken today == 0, explicitly say:
    - “Signals were generated today but no matching trades executed on Kraken.”

- Fee model + PnL:
  - Are you currently fetching real fee information from Kraken (via any endpoint like TradeVolume)? Answer yes/no and show the exact function you use.
  - For the LAST CLOSED TRADE (entry + exit pair) you can find:
    - Compute the net % return after fees, using your real fee logic.
    - If you cannot compute this because fees or exits are missing, say exactly what is missing.

- Over-trading / rate limit safety:
  - In the last 60 minutes:
    - How many orders did you attempt to place (regardless of success)?
    - Did you hit any Kraken rate-limit errors?
    - Did any internal rate-limiter or safety kill-switch block a trade? If so, show the reason string(s).

- Final yes/no:
  - Based ONLY on everything above, and with zero guessing:
    - Have you successfully placed even ONE fully-automatic AUTOPILOT trade (source="autopilot", not command/force_test) on LIVE Kraken in the last 7 days?
    - Answer strictly “yes” or “no”, then justify using concrete trade ids and timestamps (or explicitly say there are none).
