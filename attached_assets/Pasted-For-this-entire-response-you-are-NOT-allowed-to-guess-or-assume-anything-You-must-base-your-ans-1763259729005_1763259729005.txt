For this entire response, you are NOT allowed to guess or assume anything.  
You must base your answers ONLY on:

- Your executed_orders table / internal execution log
- Your trades table / telemetry DB
- Real Kraken trade history via your live exchange client

Do NOT place any trades. Read-only diagnostics only.

Answer ALL of the following in ONE response:

1) Mode & universe
- What trading mode are you in right now (live or paper)?
- Are you currently using the Crypto Universe Scanner or a static SYMBOLS list?
- List the full set of symbols you are currently evaluating each cycle.

2) Trades in the last 24 hours (REAL, timestamp-based)
- Using your trades table OR Kraken trade history with a REAL 24h time filter:
  - How many trades exist in the last 24 hours? Answer with a single integer.
- Then list each of those trades with:
  - symbol
  - side
  - amount
  - price
  - timestamp
  - trade id
  - source field exactly as stored (autopilot / command / force_test / unknown)

You MUST only count trades whose timestamp is within the last 24 hours.  
If there are 0 trades in the last 24 hours, say: “Trades in the last 24 hours: 0” and do NOT list older trades.

3) Internal execution log (executed_orders)
- Show me the last 10 entries from your internal executed_orders log.
  For each entry include:
  - timestamp
  - symbol
  - side
  - quantity
  - price
  - order_id
  - trading_mode
  - source
- If there are 0 entries, say exactly: “executed_orders log: 0 entries.”

4) Autopilot vs command vs force_test (last 24 hours)
Based ONLY on:
- your trades table AND/OR executed_orders log with a REAL 24h time filter:

Give me three integers:
- Number of trades in the last 24 hours with source="autopilot"
- Number with source="command"
- Number with source="force_test"

If there are none in a category, that category’s number must be 0.

5) Consistency check
- Confirm explicitly that:
  - The total trades in the last 24 hours from step (2)
  = the sum of (autopilot + command + force_test) from step (4).
- If they do NOT match, say: “Mismatch between 24h trade count and source breakdown” and explain why based on the actual data.

You are not allowed to use “last 24 hours” language for any trade that is older than 24 hours by timestamp.
