I want to know if Zyn is actually TRYING to trade automatically, or if the strategy filters are blocking 100% of setups.

Answer this based ONLY on real data from evaluation_log and the strategy code.

Timeframe to analyze: last 24 hours of LIVE mode evaluations.

────────────────────────
STEP 1 – DECISION STATS FROM EVALUATION_LOG
────────────────────────

1) Query evaluation_log for the last 24 hours where trading_mode = 'live'.

For that set, give me a breakdown of counts by decision, for example:

- HOLD
- SKIP
- NO_TRADE
- ENTER_LONG
- ENTER_SHORT
- RANGE_ENTRY
- TREND_ENTRY
- Any other decision values actually used

Return something like:

- total_evals = X
- decisions = {
    "HOLD": N1,
    "SKIP": N2,
    "ENTER_LONG": N3,
    ...
  }

If there are NO decisions that look like "ENTER_*", "RANGE_*", "TREND_*", or any kind of "ENTER", say that explicitly.

2) Also give me a breakdown of regimes for the same rows:

- regimes = {
    "NO_TRADE": N_nt,
    "RANGE": N_rg,
    "TREND_UP": N_tu,
    "TREND_DOWN": N_td,
    ...
  }

────────────────────────
STEP 2 – CHECK IF ENTRY SIGNALS ARE EVER GENERATED
────────────────────────

Look at the strategy code in strategy_orchestrator.py and any related files.

1) Identify the specific decisions that correspond to "we want to open a position now". For example:
   - _range_strategy(...) returning a TradeSignal with something like action="ENTER_LONG"
   - _trend_up_strategy(...)
   - Anything that triggers open_position_with_brackets(...) in autopilot.py.

2) For each such “entry” decision:
   - Tell me what exact decision string gets logged into evaluation_log (decision field).
   - Tell me what conditions must be met for that decision to happen (high level: RSI, BB%, trend, etc.).

3) Cross-check with the last 24 hours of evaluation_log:
   - Did ANY of those entry-type decision strings appear at all?
   - If yes: how many times and at what timestamps?
   - If no: explicitly say: “In the last 24 hours, the strategy NEVER produced an entry signal in LIVE mode.”

────────────────────────
STEP 3 – CHECK IF RISK/LIMITS ARE BLOCKING ENTRIES AFTER SIGNAL
────────────────────────

If you find that there WERE entry signals in the last 24 hours:

1) For a couple of examples (2–3 entry evaluations):
   - Look at the corresponding code path in autopilot.py after the signal is generated.
   - Answer:
     - Did can_trade_today(...) allow or block it?
     - Did calculate_per_trade_risk / calculate_active_risk block it?
     - Did Krakens minimum order size / min cost logic block it?
   - For each example, say clearly:
     - “Signal said ENTER, but order was BLOCKED by X.”

2) If some entries DID turn into real order placement calls:
   - Tell me how many times open_position_with_brackets(...) was actually called in the last 24h from autopilot (NOT from force trade commands).
   - If that number is 0, say so explicitly.

────────────────────────
STEP 4 – BOTTOM-LINE DIAGNOSIS
────────────────────────

Based ONLY on the last 24h data and code:

Answer in 2–4 clear sentences:

1) Is the reason I saw **no automatic trades all day** because:
   - (A) The strategy literally never produced any entry signal (filters too strict), OR
   - (B) The strategy produced entries but risk management / limits / min-size blocked them, OR
   - (C) The strategy produced entries and the code SHOULD have placed orders, but the autopilot never actually called open_position_with_brackets (wiring bug).

2) Tell me which of A/B/C is the primary cause, and why.

Do NOT change any code. Just give me the stats and the concrete diagnosis.
