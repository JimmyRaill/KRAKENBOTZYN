You’re jumping ahead a bit 🙂

Right now I do NOT want you to fix anything yet or ask me what to do next.

I want you to FINISH the full health audit I asked for earlier.

Treat this as a continuation of that PLAN/REVIEW request:

- DO NOT modify any code.
- DO NOT change any configs or env vars.
- You may RESTART the chat workflow if you need to clear the port conflict just to read logs, but do not change logic.

You already confirmed:
- Autopilot is running with all gates on and behaving logically.
- Markets are quiet so no trades are being taken.
- There are some stale paper-mode DB entries causing harmless OCO noise.
- Chat interface has a port conflict.

Now I need you to COMPLETE the full written audit report in the exact structure I requested before, so I can paste it into another assistant for a second review.

Please ignore the “what do you want to do next” part and instead produce a thorough REPORT ONLY.

Your final response in this chat must be structured EXACTLY like this (mandatory):

1. **ARCHITECTURE SUMMARY**  
   - Bullet points per module explaining roles and interactions (autopilot, execution_manager, bracket_order_manager, reconciliation_service, oco_monitor, position_tracker, evaluation_log, fee_model, strategy_orchestrator, trading_config, risk_manager, sl_order_enrichment, etc.).  
   - Mention any obviously unused or legacy logic.

2. **CURRENT CONFIG SNAPSHOT**  
   - Effective runtime values for:
     - EXECUTION_MODE  
     - Whether brackets are used  
     - Risk per trade, max position USD, max daily loss  
     - FEE_GATE_ENABLED + safety multiplier  
     - REGIME_FILTER_ENABLED + ATR %, volume, trend/ADX thresholds  
     - SYMBOL_WHITELIST / SYMBOL_BLACKLIST  
     - Decision stats enabled/disabled

3. **BRACKET / OCO PIPELINE STATUS**  
   - Step-by-step description of how a LIMIT_BRACKET LONG trade flows:
     - Signal → entry decision → maker limit placement → partial fills → TP/SL creation → OCO monitoring → cleanup.  
   - Confirm pending_child_orders + executed_orders schema usage and open_positions.json behavior.  
   - List any issues or edge cases you see.

4. **FILTERS & DECISION STATS BEHAVIOR**  
   - Describe the full decision flow: symbol filter → regime filter → fee gate → risk → final action.  
   - Summarize what recent logs show about:
     - How often each filter blocks,  
     - Whether fee gate is actually active,  
     - Whether decision stats counters are being updated consistently.

5. **DORMANT / LEGACY / EXPERIMENTAL AREAS**  
   - List futures, paper mode, old strategies, or other unused features.  
   - For each, note:
     - Whether it’s harmless to leave,  
     - Whether it could cause confusion or conflicts if accidentally enabled later.

6. **RECENT LOGS HEALTH REPORT**  
   - List:
     - Critical errors (if any),  
     - Non-critical but important warnings (like the stale paper-mode OCO noise),  
     - Repeated noise we can probably ignore.  
   - Explain each in plain language.

7. **OVERALL VERDICT & RISK LIST**  
   - Give a clear overall verdict on Zyn’s current health (e.g., “structurally sound but strict and conservative”).  
   - Then list risks as:
     - CRITICAL – must fix before increasing risk,  
     - IMPORTANT – should fix soon but safe at tiny risk,  
     - NICE-TO-HAVE – cleanup and polish.

IMPORTANT:
- This is STILL a PLAN/REVIEW phase. Do NOT implement fixes yet.
- I only want the detailed written report, in that exact 1–7 structure, so I can paste it into another assistant for a deeper second review.

Please now produce that full report as your next message.
