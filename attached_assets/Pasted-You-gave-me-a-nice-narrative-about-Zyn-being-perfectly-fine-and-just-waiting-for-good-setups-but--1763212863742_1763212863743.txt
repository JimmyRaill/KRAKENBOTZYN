You gave me a nice narrative about Zyn being “perfectly fine” and just waiting for good setups, but I need ENGINEERING PROOF and CONCRETE CHANGES, not a story.

Do not give me another high-level explanation. I want file paths, function names, code snippets, and raw logs. If something does not exist or is not implemented, say “not implemented” and then implement it.

Do all of the following, step by step:

Step 1 – Show me the actual code paths (no hand-waving)
	•	Paste:
	•	The file path and function name of the main scheduler/autopilot loop that runs every 5 minutes.
	•	The file path and function name of the main strategy evaluation function that decides TRADE vs NO_TRADE.
	•	The exact place where LIVE vs PAPER mode is selected (file, function, and code snippet).
	•	The exact place where regime = "NO_TRADE" (or equivalent) is set, and paste the FULL if/else or match block that defines those conditions.
	•	The exact places where AGGRESSIVE_RANGE_TRADING and ENABLE_FORCE_TRADE are read from the environment and used in code. Paste those code blocks.

If you cannot paste a given snippet because it does not exist, explicitly write:
“[X] is not implemented yet” and then implement it.

Step 2 – Show me raw evaluation logs, not a summary
	•	Query whatever storage Zyn uses for evaluation logs (DB, file, etc.) and paste the last 10 evaluations in RAW form. For each evaluation, I want at minimum:
	•	timestamp
	•	symbol / pair
	•	regime (e.g. RANGE, NO_TRADE, TREND, etc.)
	•	ADX (or equivalent trend metric)
	•	RSI
	•	Bollinger-band position or equivalent range metric
	•	volume / liquidity metric you actually use
	•	the exact blocking reason or rule that prevented a trade (e.g. “RSI 57 >= 45 threshold” or “BB_pos 0.63 > 0.40 threshold”)
Do not paraphrase these. Paste the real stored values or the real log lines.

If such logs are not currently stored, explicitly say so and then:
	•	Implement a logging mechanism (DB table or file) that records the fields above for every evaluation.
	•	Implement a function/command that returns the last N evaluations in a structured way so I can call it from the chat UI (for example, a command like “show last 10 evaluations”).

Step 3 – Prove that LIVE order placement actually works today
I want a FORCE TRADE test path that is fully wired and visible.
	•	Show me the exact code that:
	•	Checks ENABLE_FORCE_TRADE.
	•	Handles a user command like “Force trade test on ETH/USD”.
	•	Builds the order payload (pair, side, type, volume, price if limit, stop loss, take profit).
	•	Sends it to Kraken in LIVE mode.
	•	Logs the Kraken request and response.

Paste all relevant functions with file paths.

If any of this does not exist yet, implement it as follows:
	•	When ENABLE_FORCE_TRADE=1 and I send “Force trade test on ETH/USD”:
	•	Place a tiny LIVE market order (around $10–$15 notional) on ETH/USD.
	•	Immediately attach stop loss and take profit (bracket order) according to our default risk rules.
	•	Log, at minimum:
	•	timestamp
	•	mode (LIVE)
	•	pair
	•	side
	•	volume
	•	Kraken order id(s)
	•	full Kraken response payload
	•	Make sure nothing about this force-trade path can run unless ENABLE_FORCE_TRADE=1. When the flag is 0 or missing, the command must refuse to run.

Step 4 – Add a “debug status” command I can call from chat
Implement a chat command like debug status or show diagnostics that returns a concise but detailed snapshot of what Zyn is actually doing right now. The response should include:
	•	current mode (LIVE or PAPER) and which API keys/account it is using
	•	current equity / balance it thinks it has
	•	timestamp and pair of the last evaluation
	•	regime of the last evaluation
	•	key indicators of the last evaluation (ADX, RSI, BB position, volume)
	•	the decision (TRADE or NO_TRADE) and the blocking reason if NO_TRADE
	•	number of evaluations run in the last 24 hours
	•	number of trades placed in the last 24 hours in LIVE mode

Show me the code for this command (file + function), and an example of the exact JSON or structured object it returns before the chat layer formats it.

Step 5 – Tighten or confirm the filters based on real data
Once the logging is in place and we can see the real evaluations, do the following:
	•	Based on the last 24–48 hours of evaluations, compute:
	•	How many times all filters except RSI and BB-position passed.
	•	How many potential trades were blocked ONLY by:
	•	price > BB threshold, or
	•	RSI above its threshold.
	•	Use those statistics to answer:
	•	Are our filters so tight that we are realistically blocking almost everything?
	•	If we turned on AGGRESSIVE_RANGE_TRADING, how many of those would have passed?

Answer with actual counts and percentages based on the logged evaluations, not guesses.

Step 6 – Summarize concrete fixes and changes made
At the end, I want a short list of concrete changes you made. For example:
	•	“Added evaluation logging to [file: X, function: Y] with fields: …”
	•	“Implemented force-trade command in [file: A, function: B]”
	•	“Implemented debug status command in [file: C, function: D]”
	•	“Adjusted RSI threshold with AGGRESSIVE_RANGE_TRADING to …” (if you changed it)

Do not just say “Zyn is working perfectly.” I want:
	•	exact code locations,
	•	real logs,
	•	and explicit confirmation that LIVE order placement has been tested end-to-end with a force trade (once I enable the env flag and explicitly request it).

Only when you’ve given me ALL of the above (code + logs + implemented commands) should you give any high-level commentary.
