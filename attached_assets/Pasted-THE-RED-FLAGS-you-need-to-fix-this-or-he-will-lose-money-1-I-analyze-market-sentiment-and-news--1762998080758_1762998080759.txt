THE RED FLAGS (you need to fix this, or he will lose money)
1. “I analyze market sentiment and news.”

He cannot do that unless you explicitly coded news scraping + sentiment analysis.
Right now he’s hallucinating capability.

Fix: Remove ANY claims involving:

news

sentiment

fundamentals
Unless you code those pipeline steps.

2. “I weigh indicators based on historical performance.”

He can’t do that unless:

you coded backtesting, AND

you coded indicator weighting logic.

This is a classic bot bullshitting.

3. “I will cancel an order if market conditions change significantly.”

That is WAY too vague. He needs rules, not vibes.

You need exact logic like:

“cancel if price moves more than X% from intended entry before fill”

“cancel if ATR expands beyond X”

“cancel if trend flips on timeframes ABC”

4. “I avoid emotional trading because I’m data-driven.”

That’s not an answer.
You need him to explain how he prevents runaway logic loops.

Example:

“I check if any order is already open before submitting a new one.”

“I enforce a minimum time gap between trades (cooldown).”

5. “I use resistance or profit margins for take-profit.”

No.
He needs a defined, programmable rule, not a human concept.

Examples:

Take profit = entry + (2 × stop distance)

Take profit = next Fibonacci level

Take profit = 1.5% unless volatility says otherwise

Vague statements = bugs.

6. “I track all executed orders.”

Unless you coded persistent storage or a SQL table or a JSON ledger, this is FALSE.

You must explicitly create:

order history logs

open order tables

trade journal files

Right now he’s assuming he has them.

7. “I use your risk tolerance.”

Where did he get it?
You haven’t defined it in code.

He needs a hard rule:

“Max 1% portfolio risk per trade.”

Or “max position = $50 unless overridden.”

8. He didn’t mention stop-loss TYPE

There are multiple types on Kraken:

stop-loss limit

stop-loss market

take-profit market

OCO (if supported)

Without specifying the type he uses, you’re trusting blind execution.

9. He claims he adapts to rapid market changes

That’s impossible without:

live websocket feeds

microsecond-level data

volatility filters

tail risk detection

We haven’t built that yet.

He’s just sounding smart.

10. He did NOT explain his entry signals

Which is the biggest red flag of all.

A real trading bot MUST define:

what triggers entries

what triggers exits

what cancels trades

what invalidates signals

timeframe logic

indicator logic

confluence logic

volatility filter logic

risk-per-trade

He skipped all of those.

That means he’s basically trading vibes.
