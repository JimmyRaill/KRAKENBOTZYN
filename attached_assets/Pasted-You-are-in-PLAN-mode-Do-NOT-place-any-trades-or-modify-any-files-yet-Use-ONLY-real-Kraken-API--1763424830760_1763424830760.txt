You are in PLAN mode. Do NOT place any trades or modify any files yet.  
Use ONLY: real Kraken API data, current .env, and the existing SQLite databases.  
Your job is to answer these questions with hard facts (no guessing, no assumptions).

Answer everything in clear bullet-point format.

1) MODE, API, AND AUTOPILOT STATUS
- What is the current trading mode?
  - PAPER_TRADING (0/1)?
  - KRAKEN_VALIDATE_ONLY (0/1)?
  - AUTONOMOUS (0/1)?
- Are live Kraken API credentials actually loaded and valid?
  - Are KRAKEN_API_KEY and KRAKEN_API_SECRET present in env?
  - Can you successfully call Kraken (e.g., fetch_balance) with these credentials?
- Is the autopilot loop currently running?
  - Last evaluation timestamp (UTC)?
  - Any recent fatal errors in the autopilot logs?

2) ORDER TYPE REALITY CHECK (MARKET ONLY)
- For ALL orders the bot places in LIVE mode:
  - Are they 100% `type='market'` (market buy / market sell) with NO SL/TP attached?
  - Which exact function(s) are used for live entries and exits now? (e.g., `execute_market_entry`, `execute_market_exit`, etc.)
- Confirm that:
  - The system is NOT trying to create any Kraken conditional orders (no bracket / OCO / SL/TP orders).
  - There is no leftover path still using limit or bracket orders in LIVE autopilot.

3) SYMBOL UNIVERSE AND SCANNING
- Exactly which symbols is the bot evaluating right now?  
  - List all active symbols (e.g., ADA/USD, ALCX/USD, etc.).
- Is the symbol list coming from:
  - The dynamic CryptoUniverseScanner?
  - Or a static SYMBOLS env var?
- Confirm that:
  - The scanner (or config) allows ALL Kraken spot crypto pairs that are tradable in USD (or explicitly list what filters are being applied: min volume, max assets, etc.).

4) TRADES IN LAST 24 HOURS (REALITY CHECK VS KRAKEN)
Use a REAL 24-hour window from current UTC time (now - 24h):

- From Kraken API:
  - How many trades exist in the last 24 hours? (single integer)
  - List each trade with:
    - symbol
    - side (buy/sell)
    - amount
    - price
    - timestamp (UTC)
    - trade id
- From internal DBs:
  - In `executed_orders` table:
    - How many entries in the last 24 hours?
    - List them with:
      - timestamp
      - symbol
      - side
      - quantity
      - price
      - order_id
      - trading_mode
      - source (autopilot / command / force_test / unknown)
  - In `trades` table (telemetry DB):
    - How many entries in the last 24 hours?
    - List them with:
      - symbol
      - side
      - amount
      - price
      - timestamp
      - source

- Then state explicitly:
  - Do Kraken trades (last 24h) match internal logs (executed_orders + trades table) 1:1?
    - If NOT, describe every discrepancy clearly.

5) AUTOPILOT VS MANUAL / FORCE TRADES (LAST 24 HOURS)
- Of all trades from the last 24 hours:
  - How many were placed by:
    - autopilot
    - manual command
    - force_test
  - Show the breakdown and list each trade with:
    - symbol
    - timestamp
    - side
    - size
    - price
    - source

- Answer explicitly:
  - Has the AUTOPILOT (not force_test, not manual) placed ANY real trades on Kraken in the last 24 hours?
  - If yes, list them all with full detail.
  - If no, say “No confirmed autopilot trades on Kraken in the last 24 hours.”

6) FEE MODEL AND FEE AWARENESS
- How does the bot currently obtain Kraken trading fees?
  - Is it calling any Kraken fee endpoint (or ccxt fee API)?
  - If not, what hardcoded fee values is it using (maker %, taker %)?
- Are ALL live trades treated as taker (market) trades for fee math?
- For the last 10 closed trades (if any exist as matched entry/exit pairs):
  - For each, compute:
    - gross PnL (before fees)
    - total fees paid (entry fee + exit fee)
    - net PnL (after fees)
- If the system cannot compute fee-adjusted PnL:
  - Say exactly what is missing (e.g., no fee data, no matched exits, etc.).

7) RISK, DAILY LOSS LIMIT, AND TRADE LIMITS
- What is the current risk per trade as a % of equity?
  - Exact value used in code/config (e.g., 0.25% / 0.5%, etc.).
- What is the current DAILY loss limit?
  - Confirm it is $50 EXACTLY (no “$50” string bugs).
  - Confirm how the kill-switch is implemented and what it will do when -$50 net for the day is hit (stop trading?).
- How many trades per day is the bot allowed to make?
  - Are there any limits like:
    - max_trades_per_day
    - max_trades_per_symbol
    - cool-downs between trades?
  - If there are ANY caps or cooldowns, list the exact numbers.
  - If there are NO caps, confirm that “there is currently no explicit max trades/day limit in config.”

8) STRATEGY + EXECUTION CONSISTENCY (MARKET-ONLY MODE)
- Confirm that the strategy logic (entry/exit signals) is compatible with market-only execution:
  - On a LONG entry signal:
    - Which function runs?
    - Does it always place a market BUY?
  - On an exit/SELL signal:
    - Which function runs?
    - Does it always place a market SELL?
- Confirm there is NO remaining dependence on stop-loss or take-profit orders:
  - Position exit is driven by strategy signals / regime changes only.
  - No code path that assumes a SL/TP order exists on the exchange.

- For the last 10 LONG signals generated by the strategy (today):
  - For each:
    - symbol
    - timestamp
    - did an actual market BUY get placed? (yes/no)
    - if NO, what was the exact reason? (e.g., risk limit, daily loss limit, error)

9) “MAXIMUM DAILY PROFIT” BEHAVIOR (REALISTIC CHECK)
- In the current code, what *practical* constraints limit trade frequency?
  - Any per-candle / per-symbol restrictions?
  - Any global throttles (beyond Kraken rate limits)?
- In the last 24 hours:
  - How many valid LONG/entry signals passed all filters?
  - Of those, how many resulted in real trades?
- Is there *any* extra logic artificially blocking trades that should otherwise be allowed by risk + loss + fee rules?

10) FINAL YES/NO SUMMARY (NO HAND-WAVING)
Answer these explicitly at the end:

- “Is the bot currently:
  - (a) Scanning live Kraken markets in real time?
  - (b) Generating entry/exit signals from real-time data?
  - (c) Placing MARKET BUY and MARKET SELL orders on Kraken when signals pass all risk/limit checks?
  - (d) Logging every executed order into executed_orders and trades table with correct source?”

- If ANY of (a)–(d) is NO or UNKNOWN, list:
  - Which ones fail.
  - The exact technical reason.
  - The specific file/function that needs to be fixed.

Again: NO guessing. If you cannot confirm something from real data, say exactly what you can’t confirm and why.
