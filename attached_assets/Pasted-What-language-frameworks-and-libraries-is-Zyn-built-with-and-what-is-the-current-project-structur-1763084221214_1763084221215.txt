What language, frameworks, and libraries is Zyn built with, and what is the current project structure?

What is the main entrypoint for Zyn’s runtime logic, and how is it started in this Replit project?

How does Zyn schedule evaluations and trading decisions over time, and where is that scheduler implemented in the code?

How does Zyn distinguish between PAPER mode and LIVE mode, and where is that mode flag set, stored, and checked in the code?

How does Zyn connect to Kraken’s API, and which files or functions handle authentication and API calls?

How are API keys and sensitive credentials loaded and managed in this project, and are they ever logged or stored in plain text?

What is the full flow for placing a trade, from signal generation to order submission to confirmation, step by step in code terms?

Where is the trade execution confirmation logic implemented, and what conditions must be true before a trade is marked as executed or filled?

How does Zyn fetch balances, open orders, and trade history from Kraken, and which functions or modules handle those operations?

How does Zyn calculate position size, risk per trade, and maximum active risk, and where is that logic defined?

How are stop-loss orders and take-profit orders created, attached, and managed in the code, and what Kraken endpoints are used for that?

How does Zyn decide which symbols or markets to trade, and where is the list of tradable pairs or filters defined?

What indicators and timeframes does Zyn currently use for entries and exits, and where are those indicators calculated in the code?

How does Zyn log its decisions, errors, API responses, and trades, and where are those logs stored or printed?

What error handling and retry logic exist around Kraken API calls, and how does Zyn behave when an API call fails or times out?

Are there any known fallback responses or generic error messages that can be triggered instead of detailed diagnostics, and where are they defined?

How does Zyn keep internal state between evaluations, such as open positions, pending orders, and strategy state, and where is that state stored?

Does Zyn persist any data to disk or a database, and if so, what data is stored and in which files or tables?

What unit tests or integration tests currently exist for Zyn, and what parts of the trading flow do they cover or fail to cover?

How can we run a dry-run or simulation of the full trading pipeline using historical or mocked data inside this project?

What current limitations, edge cases, or “to do” items are already noted in the code or comments for Zyn?

Are there any parts of Zyn that still rely on assumptions or inferred state instead of direct Kraken API confirmation, and where are they located?

How long does a typical evaluation loop take from start to finish, and what are the main performance bottlenecks if any?

What is the safest way to fully disable all LIVE trading behavior in this project while still allowing PAPER mode and diagnostics to run?

If you had to refactor one core module to make Zyn more reliable and easier to debug, which module would it be and why?
