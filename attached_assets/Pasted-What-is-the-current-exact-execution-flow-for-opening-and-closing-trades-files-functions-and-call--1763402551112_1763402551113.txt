What is the current exact execution flow for opening and closing trades (files, functions, and call chain) from strategy signal → order placement → confirmation → logging?

Where in the code is the order type chosen (market vs limit), and how is it currently wired (which file/function decides type='limit' or type='market')?

What timeframes and evaluation cadence is the autopilot currently using (e.g., 5m candles every 60s, any 1m or tick-level logic already present)?

How many orders per minute / per hour is the current system capable of sending at maximum, and where are Kraken API rate limits handled (rate limiter or backoff logic)?

Is there already any global throttle on commands (e.g., max trades per day, per symbol, or per time window), and where is it configured?

How are fees currently handled:

Where is fee information pulled from (Kraken API, ccxt, hardcoded, or ignored)?

Does any existing logic explicitly subtract maker/taker fees when computing PnL or minimum edge per trade?

Does the bot currently distinguish between maker and taker fees, and where is that decision made (config file / risk module / execution module)?

Is there an existing function or module that computes “expected profit per trade” or “edge” in % terms, and if so, where is it and how is it currently calculated?

Where is the risk sizing logic defined (position size per trade, max risk per trade, max active risk), and does it assume stop-loss distances, or can it be decoupled for pure market-in/market-out?

Are there any parts of the strategy that explicitly rely on having a stop-loss or take-profit level (e.g., ATR-based SL/TP distances baked into the signal engine)?

How does the bot currently determine when to exit a trade (what modules/functions drive SELL decisions), and does that logic already support market sells without TP/SL?

Is there a centralized place to query the full Kraken fee schedule (trading fees by pair/tier) in the app, or will this need to be added (e.g., via ccxt fetch_trading_fee(s) or Kraken-specific endpoints)?

Is there already a telemetry or metrics module that tracks realized PnL per trade including fees, and if so, where is it and how does it calculate net PnL?

Are there any safeguards currently in place to prevent over-trading or API bans (such as exponential backoff, global cooldowns, or circuit breakers) and where are they implemented?

What is the target minimum net edge per trade (in % or USD) that we should enforce after accounting for fees, and is that currently configurable in any file?

Where are the current symbols/universe defined, and is there any per-symbol config that might need adjustment for fee-aware scalping (e.g., min volatility, min volume filters)?

Does the system already have a full-app diagnostic or self-check routine (database connections, API keys, mode flags, log integrity, etc.), and if yes, where is it defined and how is it invoked?

How are errors currently surfaced from order placement (Kraken/ccxt exceptions) back up to the LLM layer, and is there already a standardized error object or log format?

After code changes, what is the standard procedure in this project for restarting “both workflows” (which workflows exactly, and how are they started/restarted in this Replit setup)?
