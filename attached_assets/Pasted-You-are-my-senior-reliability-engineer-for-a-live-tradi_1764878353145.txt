You are my senior reliability engineer for a live trading bot named ZIN running on Kraken via Python.

I have just PUBLISHED this Replit as a **Reserved VM deployment**. I want you to do a STRICTLY DIAGNOSTIC PASS ONLY right now – do NOT change any code or configs unless you find a clear bug that would break the bot. If you think a change is needed, STOP and summarize the proposed change instead of applying it.

Goals of this check:
1) Confirm the deployed VM is running the bot correctly
2) Confirm ONLY ONE trading loop is live (no duplicate bots)
3) Confirm trading mode, secrets, and logging are correct in the deployed environment
4) Confirm there were no errors during publishing that could affect trading

Please go through these steps explicitly and answer them one by one:

1. Deployment / process check
- Inspect the deployment configuration (publishing / deployment settings) and confirm:
  - Deployment type is **Reserved VM**
  - The **run command** is `python3 main.py` (or whatever entrypoint we intended)
- From the VM logs, confirm that:
  - main.py started successfully
  - autopilot / trading loop started (look for log lines that indicate the loop is running)
  - there are no immediate tracebacks, import errors, or configuration errors at startup

2. Double-instance protection (make sure only one Zin is trading)
- Check if ANY of the following are also running:
  - Replit Workflows still running `python autopilot.py`
  - The normal “Run” button process running a second instance of the bot
- Verify that in the current state:
  - ONLY the Reserved VM instance is running the trading loop
  - There is NOT a second process that could also place trades
- If you find a potential second instance, DO NOT stop anything yourself – just:
  - Identify exactly where it’s running from (workflow, Run button, etc.)
  - Tell me what to turn off or reconfigure.

3. Trading mode, secrets, and Kraken config (DEPLOYED environment)
- Inspect the **deployment secrets** (NOT the dev workspace ones) and verify:
  - Kraken API key and secret exist and are non-empty
  - `KRAKEN_VALIDATE_ONLY` is set to `0` (live trading enabled)
  - Any other key trading flags (like EXECUTION_MODE, TRADE_INTERVAL_SEC, etc.) have the expected values
- Confirm that in the deployed VM:
  - We are in **LIVE** mode (not paper unless that’s what the code says is default)
  - We are using **market-only entries and exits** (per our latest changes)
  - Shorts/margin/futures are **still disabled** (spot-only trading)

4. Data logging and directories (production side)
- Confirm that the deployment is writing logs and data to the expected locations:
  - `data/decisions/...`
  - `data/trades/...`
  - `data/daily/...`
  - `data/anomalies/...`
- Verify that new decision/trade entries are being created **after** the time of deployment (i.e., production VM is actually evaluating the market and logging events).
- Confirm that there is no path or permissions issue in the VM (for example, not failing to write JSONL/JSON files).

5. Discord + health / heartbeat behavior
- Check the code paths for Discord alerts and confirm they are wired to the same environment variables in the deployment secrets.
- From logs, verify:
  - That at least one Discord notification has been attempted from the deployed VM (if enough time has passed)
  - There are no repeated errors about failing to connect to Discord webhooks.

6. Error / anomaly scan after deployment
- Scan the logs starting from the publish time and look for:
  - Any recurring stack traces
  - Any API auth failures to Kraken
  - Any “rate limit exceeded” loops
  - Any anomalies logged by our anomaly or data logging system
- Summarize:
  - Whether the bot has successfully completed at least one evaluation cycle on the VM
  - Whether it has already placed any trades from the VM instance
  - Any warnings that might impact reliability but haven’t crashed the bot

7. Final status report for me (very important)
Produce a concise status report with the following sections:

- Deployment status:
  - Is the Reserved VM currently running without errors?
  - What command is it running?
- Instance count:
  - How many trading loops did you detect?
  - Are we safe that only ONE instance can place trades right now?
- Trading config:
  - Live vs paper
  - Market-only execution confirmed?
  - Spot-only confirmed (no shorts/margin/futures)?
- Data/logging:
  - Are new decisions/trades being logged post-deployment?
- Alerts/Discord:
  - Any signs of webhook/alert failures?
- Recommendations:
  - List any concrete follow-up actions I should take (for example: “Disable workflow X”, “Update secret Y in deployment”, etc.)

Again: do NOT modify code or configs as part of this task unless you find a blocking bug. This pass is mainly to verify that publishing to the Reserved VM did NOT introduce issues and that there is NOT a second bot trading by accident.
