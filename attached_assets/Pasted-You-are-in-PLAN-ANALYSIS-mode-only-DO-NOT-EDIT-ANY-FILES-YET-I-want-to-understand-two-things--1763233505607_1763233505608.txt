You are in PLAN / ANALYSIS mode only. DO NOT EDIT ANY FILES YET.

I want to understand two things clearly:

1) Is the strategy actually generating ANY entry signals in the last 24 hours, or is it effectively always in NO_TRADE / HOLD?
2) Is my "universal symbol" support actually wired into autopilot, or is Zyn still hard-limited to BTC/ETH/ZEC in practice?

Use real data from evaluation_log and the actual code (autopilot, strategy, symbol-universe file).

Timeframe: last 24 hours, LIVE mode.

────────────────────────
STEP 1 – ENTRY vs NO_TRADE STATS (LAST 24H)
────────────────────────

1) Query evaluation_log for the last 24 hours where trading_mode = 'live'.

For that result set, give me:

- total_evals = <int>
- decisions = {
    "<decision_string>": count,
    ...
  }
- regimes = {
    "<regime_string>": count,
    ...
  }

I want the EXACT distinct values for `decision` and `regime`, not guesses.

2) Identify which decision strings correspond to “we actually tried to open a position”, e.g.:

- ENTER_LONG_*
- RANGE_LONG_ENTRY / TREND_UP_ENTRY
- Any decision that, in the code, leads to calling `open_position_with_brackets(...)` or equivalent.

List those “entry-type” decision strings explicitly, then tell me:

- How many times each of those appeared in the last 24 hours (with counts).

If the count for ALL entry-type decisions is 0, say clearly:
> “In the last 24 hours in LIVE mode, the strategy produced ZERO entry signals.”

────────────────────────
STEP 2 – SYMBOL UNIVERSE: WHAT ARE WE ACTUALLY TRADING?
────────────────────────

Now I want you to inspect how symbols are determined for the autopilot loop.

1) In autopilot.py, show:

- The code that defines `symbols = ...` in `run_forever()` and/or `loop_once()`.
- How that list is built:
  - Does it come strictly from env var SYMBOLS?
  - Is there any call into a separate “universal symbol” file/module?

Paste the relevant snippet(s) with line numbers.

2) Locate the "universal cryptocurrency" file/module we previously added (for example something like:

- symbols_universe.py
- all_symbols.py
- markets_universe.json
- or whatever name you can find that clearly holds a large list of tradable Kraken symbols,

and answer:

- File path + name.
- How it exposes the full symbol list (e.g. a function like `get_all_spot_markets()` or a constant list).
- Where (if anywhere) autopilot or strategy calls into that file.

3) Tell me plainly:

- Is the autopilot currently restricted to SYMBOLS from the .env only (like "BTC/USD,ETH/USD,ZEC/USD")?
- Or is it already wired to dynamically pull from the universal symbol list and then filter?

If the universal symbol file is present but NOT actually used anywhere in the autopilot / main loop, say:

> “The universal symbol file exists but is currently unused for symbol selection. Autopilot only trades symbols manually listed in the SYMBOLS env var.”

────────────────────────
STEP 3 – DIAGNOSIS: STRICTNESS vs UNIVERSE
────────────────────────

Based on:

- The entry/decision stats from STEP 1, and
- The symbol-universe wiring from STEP 2,

I want a concise 3–5 sentence diagnosis:

1) Is the main reason for “no trades all day” that:
   - (A) The strategy never generates entries (filters too strict) EVEN for the symbols it sees, OR
   - (B) The symbol universe is extremely narrow (BTC/ETH/ZEC only) so there just aren’t enough qualifying setups, OR
   - (C) Both: strict filters + narrow universe combine to almost never produce trades.

2) Explicitly state which of A/B/C is the primary reason GIVEN THE LAST 24 HOURS OF DATA.

Do NOT change any code yet. Just give me:
- The stats,
- The symbol-universe wiring,
- And a clear explanation of what’s limiting trades right now.
