- Question 1 – Time + Mode + Universe
  For this response you are NOT allowed to guess. Use ONLY your real config, DBs, and (if available) Kraken. Answer all of this:
  1) What is the current UTC time (exact ISO timestamp)?
  2) What trading mode are you in right now? (live / paper)
  3) What execution style are you using right now? (market-only / brackets)
  4) Are Kraken API credentials currently loaded and passing your health check? (yes/no – and show the last health-check result)
  5) Which symbols did you evaluate in your most recent full loop? List the exact symbols.

- Question 2 – 24h Trades (Strict, No Guessing)
  For this response you are NOT allowed to guess. Use ONLY:
  – Kraken trade history (if keys exist)
  – Your local executed_orders table
  – Your local trades/telemetry DB
  Answer ALL of this with a REAL 24-hour cutoff:
  1) How many trades exist in the last 24 hours? (single integer)
  2) For each trade in that window, list:
     – symbol
     – side
     – amount
     – price
     – timestamp
     – trade_id (or “none” if not available)
     – source exactly as stored (autopilot / command / force_test / autopilot_test / unknown)
  3) Do the counts from:
     – Kraken history
     – executed_orders
     – trades/telemetry
     all agree? If not, clearly state the mismatch.

- Question 3 – Today’s Signals vs Executions
  For this response you are NOT allowed to guess. Use evaluation_log + executed_orders + any internal in-memory state.
  1) Since 00:00 UTC today:
     – How many evaluations have you logged?
     – How many non-HOLD signals (long / short / exit) did you generate?
     – How many actual market orders did you send to Kraken (or paper exchange), broken down by:
       • autopilot
       • command
       • force_test
  2) For the last 5 non-HOLD signals:
     – symbol
     – action (long / short / exit / sell)
     – did it result in a market order? (yes/no)
     – if NO, state the exact reason (risk limit, daily limit, execution error, etc.).

- Question 4 – Single-Symbol Autopilot Sanity
  For this response you are NOT allowed to guess. Check ONLY your real state and logs.
  1) Pick one currently-tradable symbol with decent volume (for example AR/USD or 1INCH/USD) that you are actively evaluating.
  2) For that symbol:
     – Are you currently in a position? (yes/no)
     – If yes, show:
       • side (long/short)
       • size
       • average entry price
       • how you would exit (what signal / logic would close it)
     – If no, show:
       • the last 3 non-HOLD decisions you’ve made on that symbol
       • whether any of those decisions actually produced a market order.

- Question 5 – Fee Awareness Check
  For this response you are NOT allowed to guess or use hard-coded assumptions if live fee fetching fails. Explain exactly what you did.
  1) Can you currently fetch real Kraken trading fee info? (yes/no)
  2) If yes:
     – Show the taker fee you are using for a common symbol (e.g., ETH/USD), and where you got it from (which function/endpoint).
  3) If no:
     – Say explicitly: “I cannot fetch real live fees right now; I am using fallback values only,” and state those fallback values.

- Question 6 – Closed-Trade PnL Reality Check
  For this response you are NOT allowed to guess. Use ONLY trades where you have both entry AND exit recorded.
  1) How many fully closed live trades (entry + exit) do you have in your DB with enough data to compute fee-adjusted PnL?
  2) If the number is > 0:
     – For the last 3 closed trades, show:
       • symbol
       • entry price and timestamp
       • exit price and timestamp
       • total fees for the round trip (if known)
       • net % return AFTER fees.
  3) If the number is 0:
     – Say exactly: “I currently have 0 fully closed, fee-aware live trades. I cannot estimate edge or profitability yet.”

- Question 7 – Final Honesty Check
  Answer this plainly and with NO guessing:
  1) In the last 7 days, can you confirm at least one REAL autopilot trade that:
     – was actually sent to Kraken (or real exchange),
     – is visible in Kraken’s trade history,
     – and is logged in your local executed_orders table with source='autopilot'?
  2) If yes, list that trade with full details and explicitly say: “This trade is confirmed both in Kraken and in executed_orders as an autopilot trade.”
  3) If no, say exactly: “I cannot confirm any fully verified LIVE autopilot trades in the last 7 days.”
