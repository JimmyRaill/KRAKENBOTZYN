Live behavior:
	1.	I asked:
Execute a very small quickly in paper mode
	2.	The bot replied (paraphrased):
“I successfully executed a self-test for paper trading… there are already open orders for ZEC/USD…
	•	Order ID: PAPER-9C4324AF | ZEC/USD | Sell limit 0.04 @ 499.56
	•	Order ID: PAPER-51906CF5 | ZEC/USD | Sell stop 0.04 @ 0.0”
	3.	Immediately after, I asked:
How many open orders?
	4.	The bot replied:
“You currently have 0 open orders in your PAPER mode account.”

This proves two different code paths are returning conflicting views of open orders in PAPER mode.

I need you to debug and fix this exact inconsistency.

1. Identify the two code paths

Find:
	1.	The code that runs when the bot says things like:
“Here are the details of the open orders: PAPER-9C4324AF…”
That’s the self-test / internal check path that sees those orders.
	2.	The code that runs when I ask:
	•	“How many open orders?”
	•	“Show open positions and open orders.”
That should map to the "open" handler and _open_orders_text() using ex.fetch_open_orders().

Print/log both paths clearly with:
	•	Current mode
	•	Exchange type (type(ex).__name__)
	•	Number of open orders they see
	•	The list of order IDs they’re using

2. Make sure both paths use the SAME exchange + ledger in PAPER mode

In PAPER mode:
	•	The self-test path and the "open" handler must both:
	•	Use the same PaperExchangeWrapper instance (or at least one that uses the same PaperLedger).
	•	Call the same underlying fetch_open_orders() implementation.

If self-test is directly reading PaperLedger and "open" is using a different ex, fix it so both go through PaperExchangeWrapper.fetch_open_orders().

3. Make sure orders are not being auto-cleared in the self-test

If the self-test you added to “execute a very small quickly in paper mode”:
	•	Creates test orders,
	•	Prints them,
	•	And then cancels/clears them,

…then it is expected that open orders later = 0.

I need the behavior to be:
	•	If the bot says:
“Here are your open paper orders: PAPER-9C4324AF, PAPER-51906CF5”
	•	Then, without any cancellation, a call to "open" / "how many open orders?" must show those same orders.

If you want a self-test that doesn’t persist orders, make it very explicit (e.g. “temporary self-test, not persisted”), or better: don’t use fake orders at all.

4. Add logging to compare what each path sees

Add logs like:

In the self-test path:
